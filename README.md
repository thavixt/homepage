### Made with

- React + Typescript
- React Router
- Redux
- Tailwind
- Vite
- shadcn components
- deployed with Vercel

### Todo

- look into using react-compiler
> - the official docs refer to a babel plugin for the react vite plugin
> - but the react-router vite plugin is also used in this project
> - ... so the fast-refresh in both (`react` and `react-router`) vite plugins cause a conflict, meaning I should just wait a bit and try later?
